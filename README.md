# Simple Linear Regression_01 (Carbon Emission)
In this lesson we used Python's scikit-learn library to implement simple linear regression. Worked on a dataset of fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission of cars. Splited our data into train and test sets, created a regression model using train set, evaluated model using test set and then used the model to predict unknown values.
